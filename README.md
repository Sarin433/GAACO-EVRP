## Steady State Genetic Algorithm

SSGA stands for Steady-State Genetic Algorithm. It is steady-state meaning that there are no generations. It differs from the Simple Genetic Algorithm, as in that tournament selection does not replace the selected individuals in the population, and instead of adding the children of the selected parents into the next generation, the two best individuals out of the two parents and two children are added back into the population so that the population size remains constant.

Feature:

- Small Generation Gap.
- Only 2 offspring produced in one generation.
- Generally used for smaller population size N.
- Less computationally expensive compared to Simple GA.
- Population size N remains constant throughout.

## How to run GA

```bash
python ga.py
```

Change input data path

```bash
    python ga.py --input_path {path_of_data}
example
    python ga.py --input_path .\data\json\homberger_{nodes}_customer_instances\
```

Change Population Size

```bash
    python ga.py --pop_size {number_of_population:int}
```

Change Mutation rate

```bash
    python ga.py --mute_prob {mutation_rate:float}
```

Change Iterations

```bash
    python ga.py --iterations {number_of_iterations:int}
```

Example

- path: .\data\json\homberger_200_customer_instances\c1_2_1.json
- population size: 1000
- mutation rate: 0.4
- iterations: 1000

```bash
    python ga.py --input_path .\data\json\homberger_200_customer_instances\c1_2_1.json --pop_size 1000 --mute_prob 0.4 --iterations 1000
```

## Development Stage:

- [x] Steady State GA
- [x] Data Transformation (from text to JSON)
- [ ] Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- [ ] Combine GA and ACO
- [ ] E-VRP Data Transformation (from text to JSON)

## Result after running

- runningtime.txt
- cost and route in figure folder
